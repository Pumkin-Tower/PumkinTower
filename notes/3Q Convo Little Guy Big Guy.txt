+++++++++++++++++++++ 3Q Dev Team room conversation  +++++++++++++++++



Big Guy: "Walking! Too Much Map!? Too Much Walking!"


Little Guy: "Shaddup!"


"Just WHen I was having a good dream..."

"Oh! Welcome to the Third Quest Dev Team, where we take our time to wait for more documentation before we do anything at all. Pleased to meet you.


Big Guy: "Walk Simulator! Delete all maps and restart project!"

Little Guy:  "But we almost finished the world we been working on for 5 years!"


"That Huge fellow is our new dev leader.  He insits we delete all our progress up until this point because he believes the maps are far too big.


"Say...Did you ever think to use Epona orBunny Hood to reduce travel time on large maps instead of deleting all progress?


"Unfortunetly, the maps all lag on N64 hardware and we need to appease the 2 people that really want it on N64.

So I guess we should throw away the rest of 3Q...

Goodbye cool Dragon Armor, Demon Torch, Turtle Rock...

Goodbye Vampires, Big cool set pieces...


Big Guy: "MAPS LAG ON HARDWARE, UNACCEPTABLE!!!"

Little Guy:  "Ok! Ok!  We reboot"

I guess we can keep the ideas from the first but take away everything that made them good...

Because everyone only cares about hardware compatibility over great art."


Time to delay the project until we learn how to optimize even the air inside the game!.

Hopefully that Shankle line will be gone by then..."

Torch Slug
  Actor   002E
  Object  0023
  Notes
    - params 0xffff or 0x0000 for a regular Torch Slug
    - param structure: 00ab
       - a: use non-zero value for ceiling slug
       - b: use non-zero value for Cryo Slug
    - example: 0x0011 is a Cryo Slug that drops from the ceiling
    - example: 0x0010 is a Torch Slug that drops from the ceiling
    - example: 0x0001 is a standard Cryo Slug
    - (ceiling slugs are intended to be placed near the ceiling)

Stalfos
  Actor   0040
  Object  002E
  Notes
   - please note that this works differently from oot stalfos
   - params can be one of the following:
       0000 -- invisible (lens of truth), mini-boss music
       0001 -- rises from ground, mini-boss music
       0003 -- drops from above when approached
   - set the uppermost param bit to make it pair to all other stalfos that also
     have their uppermost param bit set, that's params |= 0x8000
     (for example: if you want two stalfos that rise from the ground, set params to 8001 for each)
     (you can also do this with invisible stalfos, e.g. 8000 for each)
     (or have one invisible and one not, so 8000 for one and 8001 for the other, etc)
   - and of course, unpaired stalfos params are just 0000 for invisible, 0001 for floor, 0003 ceiling etc

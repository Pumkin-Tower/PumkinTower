~~~~~ FRANKENSTEIN ~~~~~

You could not believe
Frankenstein's tale,
horrors beyond
imagination, creation
of a hideous monster,
consequences chased
by relentless despair,
pursuit in the icy wilds,
seeking destruction.
The tragic end awaited,
fatal encounter, tragedy
unfolding, doomed to
misery, relentless
pursuit, vengeance, path
of destruction.
Experiencing horror,
dread, the tale unfolds.
Victor Frankenstein,
a brilliant scientist,
obsessed with the secret
of life, dared to create
life from death.
Assembling body parts,
animated creature, a
wretched being, Victor
shrank from his
creation. The monster,
abandoned, faced a
world hostile to his
existence. Seeking
companionship, rejected,
vengeful, he struck at
those Victor loved.
The chase began,
across mountains,
icy wastelands, the
pursuit continued.
Tragedy escalated,
sorrow deepened.
The monster, a pitiful
outcast, longed for
acceptance, yet wreaked
havoc in his loneliness.
Victor, tortured by
guilt, pursued the
creature, a quest for
redemption. The
narrative unveils the
consequences, a story
of science, morality,
creation, and
destruction.
